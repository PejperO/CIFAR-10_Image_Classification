# CIFAR-10_Image_Classification
This project implements and tests Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which includes 60,000 color images across 10 classes. The models achieve up to 90.45% accuracy, with training stability considerations and evaluation through confusion matrices and training history.
